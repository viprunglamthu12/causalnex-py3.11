## Installation guide

We recommend installing CausalNex in a new virtual environment for *each* of your projects. To install CausalNex:

```bash
pip install causalnex
```

To check your installation:

```bash
python -c "import causalnex"
```

If CausalNex is not installed correctly you will see an error message similar to the following:

```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'causalnex'
```

You should not see any output if CausalNex is correctly installed.
